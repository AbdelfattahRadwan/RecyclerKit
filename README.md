RecyclerKit
===========

RecyclerKit is an object pooling system that is super easy to use. Stick a TrashMan compoenent on any GameObject in your scene and drag any prefabs you want pooled into it's inspector. You can configure the total objects to preallocate and a couple other things there. You then use the spawn method where you would normally call Instantiate and the despawn method where you would normally call Destroy.


Usage
----
- drag the TrashMan script onto a GameObject in your scene
- in the TrashMan inspector, drag any prefabs that you want it to manage and setup the recycle bin details
- use the following API to manage instances:
	* TrashMan.spawn replaces your calls to Instantiate
	* TrashMan.despawn or TrashMan.despawnAfterDelay replaces your calls to Destroy

I would like to give attribution to the original inspiration for RecyclerKit but I have no clue who or where the first iteration came from. At this point, RecyclerKit is so far removed from its original inspiration that it is impossible to trace its origin.
